# ![Cuttlefish](https://raw.github.com/openaustralia/cuttlefish/master/app/assets/images/cuttlefish_80x48.png) [Cuttlefish](https://cuttlefish.io)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/allthatnet/cuttlefish.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/allthatnet/cuttlefish)

This is the [All That Net's fork](https://www.allthatnet.com/) of the open source [Cuttlefish - Lovely Transactional Email](https://cuttlefish.io) project to enable deployment in Centos 7 (incomplete, at this time) and make it more generic by using custom variables.

## Dependencies
Ruby 2.1.5, MySQL, Redis (2.4 or greater), Postfix
(Postfix is optional for local development or just trying it out. Some things like the email deliverability just won't show anything)

Also you need the following libraries:
imagemagick, libmagickwand-dev, libmysqld-dev

## To install:

We use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/) to automatically set up a fresh server with everything you need to run Cuttlefish. It's a fairly complicated affair as Cuttlefish does have quite a few moving
parts but all of this is with the purpose of making it easier for the developer sending mail.

These instructions are specifically for installing the server at https://cuttlefish.oaf.org.au.

### To install to a local test virtual machine

1. Create a file `~/.cuttlefish_ansible_vault_pass.txt` which contains the password for encrypting the secret values used in the deploy. The encrypted variables are at `provisioning/roles/cuttlefish-app/vars/main.yml`.

2. Download base box and build virtual machine with everything needed for Cuttlefish. This will take a while (at least 30 mins or so)
```
vagrant up
```

3. Deploy the application. As this is the first deploy it will take quite a while (5 mins or so). Further deploys will be much quicker. We're using the `--set-before local_deploy=true` flag to deploy to your local test virtual machine instead of production.
```
bundle exec cap --set-before local_deploy=true deploy:setup deploy:cold foreman:export foreman:start
```

4. Add to your local `/etc/hosts` file
```
127.0.0.1       cuttlefish.oaf.org.au
```

5. Point your web browser at https://cuttlefish.oaf.org.au:8443/

### To install on [Linode](https://www.linode.com/)

1. Login at the [Linode Manager](https://manager.linode.com/)

2. [Add a new Linode](https://manager.linode.com/linodes/add)

3. Select "Linode 2048" at location "Fremont, CA"

4. Select your new Linode in the dashboard

5. Click "Deploy a Linux Distribution". Choose "Ubuntu 14.04 LTS" and choose a root password. Leave everything as default.

6. Click "Boot" and wait for it to start up

8. Update `provisioning/hosts` with the name of your server (e.g. li123-45.members.linode.com)

9. Create a file `~/.cuttlefish_ansible_vault_pass.txt` which contains the password for encrypting the secret values used in the deploy. The encrypted variables are at `provisioning/roles/cuttlefish-app/vars/main.yml`.

10. To provision the server for the first time you will need to supply the root password you chose in step 5. On subsequent deploys you won't need this. To supply this password edit the `./provision_production.sh` script and temporily add the `--ask-pass` argument to the last command, then run the script:

```
./provision_production.sh
```

11. Update the server name in `config/deploy.rb`

12. Deploy the application. As this is the first deploy it will take quite a while (5 mins or so). Further deploys will be much quicker
```
cap deploy:setup
cap deploy:cold
cap foreman:export
cap foreman:restart
```

13. At this stage you might want to snapshot the disk

14. Make sure that DNS for cuttlefish.oaf.org.au points to the server ip address

14. Point your browser at https://cuttlefish.org.au

At this point you should have a basic working setup. You should be able to send test mail and see it getting delivered.

Some further things to ensure things work smoothly

1. Add DNS TXT record for cuttlefish.oaf.org.au with "v=spf1 ip4:your.server.ip4.address ip6:your.server.ip6.address -all"

2. Set up incoming email for cuttlefish.oaf.org.au (In OpenAustralia Foundation's case using Google Apps for domain). Add addresses contact@cuttlefish.oaf.org.au, bounces@cuttlefish.oaf.org.au and sender@cuttlefish.oaf.org.au

2. Ensure that the devise email address is set to contact@cuttlefish.oaf.org.au

3. Set up reverse DNS. In the Linode Manager under "Remote Access" click "Reverse DNS" then for the hostname put in "cuttlefish.oaf.org.au" and follow the instructions. This step is necessary in order to be able to sign up to receive [Feedback loop emails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_loop_%28email%29).
